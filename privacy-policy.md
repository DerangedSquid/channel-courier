# Channel Courier – Privacy Policy
_Last updated: December 2025_

This Privacy Policy explains how Channel Courier (“the bot”, “the service”) processes information when operating inside Discord servers.

---

## 1. Information We Process
Channel Courier processes only the minimum data required to perform its core functions. This includes:

### 1.1 Discord-Provided Data
- User IDs
- Voice state events (join/leave)
- Channel IDs
- Server IDs
- Bot-generated audio playback events

### 1.2 Non-Personal Technical Data
- Connection status
- Internal diagnostic logs (ephemeral)
- Error messages and runtime exceptions

The bot does **not** collect message content, personal details, IP addresses, or any data outside of Discord’s API.

---

## 2. How We Use Information
The data processed by Channel Courier is used exclusively to:

- Detect when users join or leave voice channels
- Trigger webhook notifications
- Play audio alerts
- Maintain stable voice connections
- Improve reliability and diagnose runtime issues

No data is used for analytics, profiling, advertising, or tracking.

---

## 3. Data Retention
Channel Courier does **not** store persistent logs or databases.

- All processed data is ephemeral.
- No long-term storage occurs.
- No data is written to external systems.

Once an event is handled, the associated data is discarded.

---

## 4. Data Sharing
Channel Courier does **not**:

- Sell data  
- Share data with third parties  
- Transfer data outside Discord’s ecosystem  
- Use external analytics services  

The bot operates entirely within Discord’s platform.

---

## 5. User Rights
Because Channel Courier does not store personal data, user rights are simple:

- Removing the bot from your server immediately stops all data processing.
- No additional deletion requests are required.
- No personal data exists to export or review.

---

## 6. Security
The bot uses standard Discord API authentication and follows best practices for bot security. While no system is perfectly secure, reasonable measures are taken to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.

---

## 7. Children’s Privacy
Channel Courier does not target or collect information from children. The bot inherits Discord’s age restrictions and policies.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Continued use of the bot after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.

---

## 9. Contact
If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you may contact the developer through GitHub.
